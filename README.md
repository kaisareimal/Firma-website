# Firma-website
Firma üheleheline website. Loodud VOCO UX/UI õppe veebidisaini tunni jaoks. 

This is my second study in HTML/CSS - a company's one-page showcase website.
The project aimed to create a user-friendly and responsive website that would be inviting and adhere to best practices. I believe I successfully achieved the intended goals of the project.
